# Tic Tac Toe Game Rules

## Overview
Tic Tac Toe is a simple, classic game played on a 3x3 grid. The game is played by two players who take turns marking the spaces in the grid. One player uses "X" and the other uses "O". The objective is to be the first to get three of your marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

## How to Play

### Setup
1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. One player chooses "X" and the other player chooses "O".

### Game Play
1. Players take turns placing their mark (X or O) in an empty square.
2. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the game.
3. If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is considered a draw.

### Winning the Game
A player wins by placing three of their marks in a:
- Horizontal row
- Vertical column
- Diagonal line

### Draw
If all nine squares are filled and no player has three marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.

## Example
Here's a visual representation of the grid and how the game progresses:

```
 1 | 2 | 3
-----------
 4 | 5 | 6
-----------
 7 | 8 | 9
```

- Player 1 (X) goes first and chooses a square to mark.
- Player 2 (O) then chooses an empty square to mark.
- They continue to take turns until one player gets three marks in a row or all squares are filled.

### Example Game Play
1. Player 1 (X) chooses square 1.
2. Player 2 (O) chooses square 5.
3. Player 1 (X) chooses square 2.
4. Player 2 (O) chooses square 8.
5. Player 1 (X) chooses square 3 and wins the game with three Xs in the top row.

```
 X | X | X
-----------
   | O |   
-----------
   | O |   
```

## Tips and Strategies
- Try to take the center square if it's available. It's the most advantageous position.
- Pay attention to your opponentâ€™s moves and try to block them if they are about to win.
- Think a few moves ahead to set up your own winning strategy.

## Ending the Game
- The game ends when a player wins by getting three marks in a row or when all squares are filled resulting in a draw.
